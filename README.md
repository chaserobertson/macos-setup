# MacOS Setup Scripts

These scripts complete my MacOS configuration by changing a bunch of MacOS settings (apply_os_settings.sh) and installing my base applications (install_apps.sh).

This is completely catered to my own taste and installs applications that I use.

These scripts will work on a freshly installed MacOS device. It uses [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install applications.

# Steps

- `zsh apply_os_settings.sh`
- reboot
- `zsh install_apps.sh`
- reboot

New OS defaults domain/keys can be discovered with `diff.sh`
